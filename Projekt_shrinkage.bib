title = {Stein's Estimation Rule and Its Competitors--An Empirical Bayes Approach},
abstract = {Stein's estimator for k normal means is known to dominate the MLE if k ≥ 3. In this article we ask if Stein's estimator is any good in its own right. Our answer is yes: the positive part version of Stein's estimator is one member of a class of "good" rules that have Bayesian properties and also dominate the MLE. Other members of this class are also useful in various situations. Our approach is by means of empirical Bayes ideas. In the later sections we discuss rules for more complicated estimation problems, and conclude with results from empirical linear Bayes rules in non-normal cases.},

abstract = {The innate immune response is crucial for defense against microbial pathogens. To investigate the molecular choreography of this response, we carried out a systematic examination of the gene expression program in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells responding to bacteria and bacterial products. We found a remarkably stereotyped program of gene expression induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and diverse killed bacteria. An intricately choreographed expression program devoted to communication between cells was a prominent feature of the response. Other features suggested a molecular program for commitment of antigen-presenting cells to antigens captured in the context of bacterial infection. Despite the striking similarities, there were qualitative and quantitative differences in the responses to different bacteria. Modulation of this host-response program by bacterial virulence mechanisms was an important source of variation in the response to different bacteria.},

abstract = {We present a procedure for effective estimation of entropy and mutual information from small-sample data, and apply it to the problem of inferring high-dimensional gene association networks. Specifically, we develop a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator, resulting in a procedure that is highly efficient statistically as well as computationally. Despite its simplicity, we show that it outperforms eight other entropy estimation procedures across a diverse range of sampling scenarios and data-generating models, even in cases of severe undersampling. We illustrate the approach by analyzing E. coli gene expression data and computing an entropy-based gene-association network from gene expression data. A computer program is available that implements the proposed shrinkage estimator.},

The technique employed is shrinkage of the MVULE towards a natural origin, μ<sub>0</sub>, in the parameter space. The suggested estimator is: μ̂ = (x̄ - μ<sub>0</sub>)<sup>3</sup>/(x̄ - μ<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + s<sup>2</sup>/n + μ<sub>0</sub>. The case where μ<sub>0</sub> = 0 is given special consideration. This is the general case for the normal distribution. When |μ/σ<sub>x</sub>| is small, shrinkage buys decreased MSE at the expense of increased MSE for |μ/σ<sub>x</sub>| large.},

title = {A weighted average difference method for detecting differentially expressed genes from microarray data},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under different experimental conditions is an important task in many microarray studies. However, choosing which method to use for a particular application is problematic because its performance depends on the evaluation metric, the dataset, and so on. In addition, when using the Affymetrix GeneChip(R) system, researchers must select a preprocessing algorithm from a number of competing algorithms such as MAS, RMA, and DFW, for obtaining expression-level measurements. To achieve optimal performance for detecting DEGs, a suitable combination of gene selection method and preprocessing algorithm needs to be selected for a given probe-level dataset. RESULTS: We introduce a new fold-change (FC)-based method, the weighted average difference method (WAD), for ranking DEGs. It uses the average difference and relative average signal intensity so that highly expressed genes are highly ranked on the average for the different conditions. The idea is based on our observation that known or potential marker genes (or proteins) tend to have high expression levels. We compared WAD with seven other methods; average difference (AD), FC, rank products (RP), moderated t statistic (modT), significance analysis of microarrays (samT), shrinkage t statistic (shrinkT), and intensity-based moderated t statistic (ibmT). The evaluation was performed using a total of 38 different binary (two-class) probe-level datasets: two artificial "spike-in" datasets and 36 real experimental datasets. The results indicate that WAD outperforms the other methods when sensitivity and specificity are considered simultaneously: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for WAD was the highest on average for the 38 datasets. The gene ranking for WAD was also the most consistent when subsets of top-ranked genes produced from three different preprocessed data (MAS, RMA, and DFW) were compared. Overall, WAD performed the best for MAS-preprocessed data and the FC-based methods (AD, WAD, FC, or RP) performed well for RMA and DFW-preprocessed data. CONCLUSION: WAD is a promising alternative to existing methods for ranking DEGs with two classes. Its high performance should increase researchers' confidence in microarray analyses.},

abstract = {Although cancer classification has improved over the past 30 years, there has been no general approach for identifying new cancer classes (class discovery) or for assigning tumors to known classes (class prediction). Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

title = {Accurate ranking of differentially expressed genes by a distribution-free shrinkage approach},
abstract = {High-dimensional case-control analysis is encountered in many different settings in genomics. In order to rank genes accordingly, many different scores have been proposed, ranging from ad hoc modifications of the ordinary t statistic to complicated hierarchical Bayesian models. Here, we introduce the "shrinkage t" statistic that is based on a novel and model-free shrinkage estimate of the variance vector across genes. This is derived in a quasi-empirical Bayes setting. The new rank score is fully automatic and requires no specification of parameters or distributions. It is computationally inexpensive and can be written analytically in closed form. Using a series of synthetic and three real expression data we studied the quality of gene rankings produced by the "shrinkage t" statistic. The new score consistently leads to highly accurate rankings for the complete range of investigated data sets and all considered scenarios for across-gene variance structures.},
